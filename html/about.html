    <h3>A little bit about me.</h3>
    <p>
      I am Nathan DeVries and I was born on April 15, 2003. I grew up in Redlands, California and have always loved
      both computers and music. I've played the piano since I was 4 years old and have been sang for my church a lot.
      Later on, I learned percussion and was in band from middle school to today. I have also always had an interest
      about computers as I've played video games since I was a child. That grew into having an interest about how these
      games work as I've used Scratch a lot in middle school and then learned Java in high school Today, I am always
      looking for a way to tie both of these interests together as I study both of these subjects at California Baptist
      University.
